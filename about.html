                        Inc. (2C3H), exits to serve the unhoused, unsheltered and the less fortunate. 
                        We believe ministry and service begins in the heart. Our mantra is “Feel a Need… 
                        Fill a Need. We simply exist to share the message of Jesus Christ one full belly at a time.
                         We stand on the scripture in Matthew 9:36…When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, 
                         because they were harassed and helpless…
                            <br><br>
                         -Our Mission is to be moved with compassion and offer the hands and help needed 
                        to alleviate the suffering of the hurting, the overlooked, the forgotten, and the lost.

                <p>2C3H is all about being Active in Missions—locally and abroad. We seek to reach out to those who 
                    suffer spiritually, emotionally, and physically. We currently have ongoing feeding programs in Kenya
                     Africa, and have adopted a special needs home there to support with food. We have donated two 
                     wheelchairs to help with mobility-impaired children. Our domestic cities of service include Dallas, 
                     Fort Worth, Grand Prairie, and surrounding areas, and Texarkana.Where we are today. Caring 
                     Compassionate Hearts & Helping Hands typically serves 200-400 meals weekly. We travel to various 
                     homeless encampments, under bridges, and on the streets. We take out essentials: food, water, 
                     hygiene, coats, blankets, tents, sleeping bags. We are so blessed to work alongside great 
                     non-profits, groups, and individual donors and supporters that make sure we have needed resources.

                        <p>Hi, my name is Patricia Rigsby-Scott and I'm a licensed and ordained minister 
                            and wife to my wonderful supportive husband, Cedric. He's my preparer, picker upper, 
                            and packer. He helps and supports me by letting me do what I do, and I appreciate him 
                            for that! I have always had the desire to help. Caring Compassionate Hearts & Helping 
                            Hands was birthed in 2009.</p>
